Redid badge evaluation.

:::

## 11.12-11.14: Revisit evaluation

Revisited and revised the badge criteria to (a) make them up-to-date, and (b) make sure they are *specific* to the descriptions from each badge. Hence, redoing evaluations for all eight studies.

Notes:

* careful - no, as not documented and lots of different folders and files, so takes a little time to figure out what does what, and so on
* correspond - no, took a bit of working out to figure which plots in `plotting_staff_results.r` partly contribute to paper or not

## Untimed: Update summary report

With new badge evaluation results.
