## 09.08-09.22, 09.32-09.46: Run and plot all 9 scenarios from experiment 1, with mini version of parameters

Modified `main.py` into `Experiment1.py`. Changed so it saves the time for each experiment run to txt (as important to record this, but could potentially get lost if just print to screen, when we start running larger numbers).

Ran all with 10 population and 1 generation. Wrote code to identify and loop through importing the results from experiment1/ folder.

## 09.47-09.48, 10.00-10.05: Re-ran to confirm that results were consistent between runs

This was to check that provided seeds ensured consistency. At the same time, tweaked how time was output. Indeed, **consistent between runs**, which is great and really helpful that this was already set up by the author.

Total run time for the 9 scenarios was 7 minutes.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 297

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.08', '09.22'),
    ('09.32', '09.46'),
    ('09.47', '09.48'),
    ('10.00', '10.05')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
