## 09.51-09.57, 10.52-10.55: Resuming attempt to run on remote machine

As left off yesterday, getting error:

```
...
13, in <module>
    import ExperimentRunner
  File "ExperimentRunner.py", line 15, in <module>
    import SimulatorRunner
  File "SimulatorRunner.py", line 11, in <module>
    import PODSimulation
  File "PODSimulation.py", line 13, in <module>
    import SimPy.SimPlot as simplot
  File "/home/amyremote/miniconda3/envs/hernandez2015/lib/python2.7/site-packages/SimPy/SimPlot.py", line 68, in <module>
    class SimPlot(object):
  File "/home/amyremote/miniconda3/envs/hernandez2015/lib/python2.7/site-packages/SimPy/SimPlot.py", line 69, in SimPlot
    def __init__(self, root = Tk()):
  File "/home/amyremote/miniconda3/envs/hernandez2015/lib/python2.7/lib-tk/Tkinter.py", line 1815, in __init__
    self.tk = _tkinter.create(screenName, baseName, className, interactive, wantobjects, useTk, sync, use)
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

This is related to import of `simpy.simplot`, but as simplot isn't used anywhere, I tried commenting out this import in `PODSimulation.py`. This resolved the error!

The original was population 100 and 50 generations. I anticipate this will be very long, so working up to it...

10 population, 1 generation: just a few minutes

![fig5 10 pop 1 gen](figure5_10pop_1gen.png)
![fig6 10 pop 1 gen](figure6_10pop_1gen.png)

100 population, 1 generation: 37 minutes

![fig5 100 pop 1 gen](figure5_100pop_1gen.png)
![fig6 100 pop 1 gen](figure6_100pop_1gen.png)

But seems will be important to try and run with the full version - particularly as Figure 9 is an experiment of that impact of that.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 386

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.51', '09.57')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
